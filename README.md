A batteries-included SvelteKit template for quickly bootstrapping full-stack applications.

## Stack

- 🎯 **SvelteKit** - Frontend framework with Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI
- 💳 **LemonSqueezy** - Payments, taxes, and subscription management
- 🔐 **Supabase** - Authentication and optional SQL database
- 🍃 **MongoDB** - Primary database (when needed)
- ⚡ **Vercel** - Deployment, Edge Functions, and Blob Storage
- 📧 **Brevo** - Transactional emails (signup, magic links, password reset)

## Quick Start

1. Clone this template:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitstarter.git my-app
cd my-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Fill in your environment variables in `.env`

5. Start the development server:

## AI Development with Cline

This template includes predefined prompts for Cline to help you develop faster with AI assistance. Common tasks are documented for quick implementation:

- Authentication flows
- Payment integration
- Email setup
- Database schema design
- API endpoint creation
- UI component development

Use Cline to help you implement features by referencing the stack and existing code structure. For example:
```
"Hey Cline, help me implement a new protected route for user settings using our Supabase auth"
```

## Notes

- This is a personal/friends template - feel free to modify for your needs
- Not all integrations are fully implemented yet - check the code for what's available

Happy coding! 🚀
